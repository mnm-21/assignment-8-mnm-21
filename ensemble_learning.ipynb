    "# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction using Ensemble Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores **ensemble regression techniques** to predict the hourly bike rental counts (`cnt`) from the **UCI Bike Sharing Dataset**. The dataset contains both **categorical** and **continuous** variables describing weather, seasonality, and temporal factors that influence demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to:\n",
    "1. Build and compare several regression models, including:\n",
    "   - **Decision Tree Regressor** and **Linear Regression** (as baselines)\n",
    "   - **Bagging Regressor** (to reduce variance)\n",
    "   - **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (to reduce bias)\n",
    "   - **K-Nearest Neighbors** (for diversity in model space)\n",
    "   - **Stacking Regressor** combining the above models\n",
    "2. Evaluate model performance using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.\n",
    "3. Analyze how ensemble methods improve upon single-model baselines.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion: Comparative Insights and Final Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best-Performing Model\n",
    "The **Stacking Regressor** achieved the lowest RMSE of **69.95**, outperforming all other models, including:\n",
    "| Model | RMSE |\n",
    "|:--|--:|\n",
    "| Linear Regression (baseline) | 102.14 |\n",
    "| Decision Tree | 118.47 |\n",
    "| Bagging | 112.39 |\n",
    "| Gradient Boosting | 72.90 |\n",
    "| **Stacking (KNN + Bagging + GBR → Ridge)** | **69.95** |\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the **Stacking ensemble** the most accurate and generalizable model for predicting hourly bike rentals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Stacking Outperformed the Baseline\n",
    "Stacking leverages the **bias–variance trade-off** more effectively than any single model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear Regression (baseline)** has **high bias, low variance**, capturing only global linear trends and missing nonlinear patterns.  \n",
    "- **Decision Trees and Bagging** reduce variance but still suffer from moderate bias, limiting predictive depth.  \n",
    "- **Gradient Boosting** reduces bias through sequential correction, achieving strong nonlinear performance but can overfit slightly (higher variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "By **combining diverse learners (KNN, Bagging, and Gradient Boosting)**, the Stacking Regressor benefits from:\n",
    "1. **Model Diversity:** Each base learner contributes different strengths, KNN captures local structure, Bagging stabilizes variance, and Boosting models complex patterns.  \n",
    "2. **Meta-Learner Optimization:** The Ridge meta-learner learns optimal weights to blend these models, effectively minimizing both bias and variance simultaneously.  \n",
    "3. **Error Complementarity:** When one model mispredicts, others often correct it, leading to more balanced and consistent final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Remark\n",
    "The Stacking Regressor demonstrates how intelligently combining models with complementary characteristics can outperform even strong single models.  \n",
    "It achieves **optimal bias–variance balance** and capitalizes on **model diversity**, resulting in superior predictive power and generalization performance on the bike-sharing dataset."
